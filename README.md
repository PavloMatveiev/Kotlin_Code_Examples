# Kotlin Code Examples

Welcome to the repository where I store various Kotlin code samples.

## Overview

This repository is divided into zip archives, each containing a complete Kotlin project. These projects cover a range of topics and demonstrate different aspects of Kotlin programming.

## Repository Structure

Each zip file in the repository corresponds to a different Kotlin project. Here's what you can expect in each zip file:

- **Source Code:** Complete source code files written in Kotlin.
- **Project Files:** Necessary project files, including the build scripts (`build.gradle` or `pom.xml`) and settings files for an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.

## How to Use This Repository

To use the code examples from this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Zip File:** Choose a zip file from the repository and download it to your local machine.
2. **Extract the Zip File:** Extract the contents of the zip file. This will create a project folder containing all the necessary files.
3. **Open the Project:** Open the project folder with an IDE that supports Kotlin (preferably IntelliJ IDEA).
